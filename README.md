# **Epilog PrintAPI**
*Revolutionizing Laser Printing Integration*

&nbsp;

Epilog is thrilled to present PrintAPI, a powerful tool that opens new possibilities for developers and users of Epilog Laser machines. Designed as a flexible library, PrintAPI empowers developers to seamlessly create and send print jobs to Epilog Laser machines directly from their own software environments.

With PrintAPI, users can effortlessly generate print files by combining three key components: artwork in the form of an svg file, laser settings specified in a json file, and the model of the Epilog Laser machine to be used. The result is a streamlined print file ready to be sent directly to the machine, simplifying and enhancing the entire printing process.

This new capability allows customers to fully integrate Epilog Laser machines into their existing workflows, tailoring the print file generation process to meet their specific needs and preferences. Whether for automation, customization, or scalability, PrintAPI brings the power of laser printing directly into the hands of the developers, offering unmatched flexibility and control.
